	description `With large volumes of easily captured drones left disabled after battles with the Navy, the Free Worlds realized that the re-use of these drones would be best. It was a simple modification of the docking arms to allow drones to dock with these ships. Not all the drones are Navy though. along with these ships, Southbound Shipyards also creates new drones, Bees and Mockingjays.`
