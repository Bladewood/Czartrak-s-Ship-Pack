	description "Mockingjays are Free World versions of Surveillance Drones. Based off Republic Surveiilance Drones, Mockingjays are specially equipped for listening in on communications, and recording fleet activities. They even carry some sneaky tech that changes their IFF signals to that of the Republic, making the Navy think it's their drone."
